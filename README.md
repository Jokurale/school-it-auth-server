# school-it-auth-server 🌀

◼ Integrated with [_school-it-resource-api_](https://github.com/Jokurale/school-it-resource-api)
.

## Implementation 👈

This repo contains real implementation of this [auth-server](https://github.com/Jokurale/authorization-server)

> Exchanged User.model to be handled with school-it-resource-api instead of mongoDB <br>
> MongoDB now stores only already issued token-sets (token + login)

## Backend implementation model 🗂

Graphical representation will be available at README.ME of this [repo](https://github.com/Jokurale/school-it)

## Potential further changes 🧭

Quite high change of exchanging MongoDB Token.model for an robust redis store.

## Tests 📊

Latest API coverage avilable on my git is still up to date.
